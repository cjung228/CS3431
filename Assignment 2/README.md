# Assignment 2

For this assignment, I expanded on the database created in Assignment 1 and completed a series of tasks.

1. Drop the tables and sequences at the beginning of the program to allow the ability to run the .sql file over and over without needing to reset the session. The tables must be dropped in a specific order because of integrity constraints.
2. Create tables. 
3. Write commands to print out certain parts of the tables from part 2 based on conditions.

This assignment touched upon joins, nested queries, and aggregates (i.e. MAX, SUM, and CNT) that allow for more complex database searching.
