# Assignment 1

For this assignment, I created a database to keep track of Cruise data and completed a series of tasks.

1. Delete Reservation, Customer, Cruise, TravelAgent, and Company tables at the beginning of the program to allow the ability to run the .sql file over and over without needing to reset the session. The tables must be dropped in a specific order because of integrity constraints.
2. Create tables. 
3. Write commands to print out certain parts of the tables from part 2 based on conditions.
